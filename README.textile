h2. Work in progress

Very experimental, can't actually do anything useful yet.

h2. JSEpub

Reads and handles the ebook format EPUB.

<pre><code>var ePubFile = ...; // Use HTML5 files, or download it via XHR.
var epub = new JSEpub(epubFile);
</code></pre>

h2. Installing and using

JSEpub has the following dependencies:

* "JSUnzip":http://github.com/augustl/js-unzip. EPUB files are packaged as a Zip
  archive.
* "JSInflate":http://github.com/augustl/js-inflate. Used to decompress the
  compressed files in the Zip archive.

Simply include these javascripts on your page.
