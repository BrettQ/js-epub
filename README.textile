h2. JSEpub

Reads and handles the EPUB e-book format.

<pre><code>var epubFile = ...; // Use HTML5 files or download via XHR.
var epub = new JSEpub(epubFile);

var showFirstPage = function () {
    // The spine lists all pages in correct order
    var spine = epub.opf.spine[0];

    // The manifest contains the href of the file
    var href = epub.opf.manifest[spine]["href"];

    // All the files are stored in here, indexed by href
    var doc = epub.files[href];

    // The doc is a DOMparser created DOM. You may want to
    // work with a string version of the page contents.
    var html = new XMLSerializer().serializeToString(doc);

    // Use "html" to your hearts content!
}

// Each time something happens in the processing, the callbakc is called. The
// step is a number, representing the actual step that was performed. You
// can use this to render status messages to the user as you process the file.
// The processor will also insert a tiny delay between each operation, so that
// you don't get the browser slow script warnings.
epub.processInSteps(function (step, extras) {
    var msg;

    if (step === 1) {
        msg = "Unzipping";
    } else if (step === 2) {
        msg = "Uncompressing " + extras;
    } else if (step === 3) {
        msg = "Reading OPF";
    } else if (step === 4) {
        msg = "Post processing";
    } else if (step === 5) {
        msg = "Finishing";
        showFirstPage();
    }

    // Render the "msg" here.
});</code></pre>

The library is pretty low level, to give you all the flexibility you need when you handle your EPUBs.

h2. Installing and using

JSEpub has the following dependencies:

* "JSUnzip":http://github.com/augustl/js-unzip. EPUB files are packaged as a Zip
  archive.
* "JSInflate":http://github.com/augustl/js-inflate. Used to decompress the
  compressed files in the Zip archive.

Include these scripts on your page before you include js-epub. They don't require any configuration or initialization.
