h2. JSEpub

Reads and handles the EPUB e-book format.

<pre><code>var ePubFile = ...; // Use HTML5 files, or download it via XHR.
var epub = new JSEpub(epubFile);
epub.process(); // This can take a while. Use HTML5 workers/threads if you can.

// Get the contents of the first spine entry
var spine = epub.opf.spine[0];
var href = epub.opf.manifest[spine]["href"];
var doc = this.epub.files[href];
// Convert the doc to HTML
var html = new XMLSerializer().serializeToString(doc);
</code></pre>

The library is pretty low level, to give you all the flexibility you need when you handle your EPUBs.

h2. Installing and using

JSEpub has the following dependencies:

* "JSUnzip":http://github.com/augustl/js-unzip. EPUB files are packaged as a Zip
  archive.
* "JSInflate":http://github.com/augustl/js-inflate. Used to decompress the
  compressed files in the Zip archive.

Include these scripts on your page before you include js-epub. They don't require any configuration or initialization.
